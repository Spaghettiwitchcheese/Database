I should remind you that this is now a better backup than was previously possible on my machine.
It has been updated to make it easier to work with, all files have been reordered.

Why is it not commented?
I am lazy for now. I will get to it later.

School
This folder is where school projects are. It is the most used folder there.

Testing
I put here anything that I work on while not in school.

Archive
It is an archive, where I store backup of any type of important files.

Notes
It is used for storing notes and learning material.

All of the code included in this repo is free to steal.
