# list = does allow duplicates 
# Thislist = ["Apple", "orange"]
# We can write there bool str int float 
# and we also can write multiple data types at once
# we can calculate these types 
#
# we also can use list one item from list 
# print(Thislist[1]) there is going to be in print statement
# there is also range 
# print(thislist[0:4]) from item 0 to item 3 fist is included THE LAST IS ALWAYS EXLUDED
# we also can write them without one variuble
# [0:]from 0 to the end 
# [:3] from 0 to the 3
# we can also use if statement 
# if "Apple" in Thislist:
#    print("we have apples")
# How to change items List by just typing the location of item we want to change or range of items and then using =
# thislist[1:5] = "backberry"
# at all costs remember that you need to make range last num EXCLUDED
# we can use .insert anything to our list fist int is used as desired location
# also good to mension it moves all the folowing items
